Scala.php has been discontinued.

Despite immense<sup>[1](https://twitter.com/kubukoz/status/1774701423982227456)</sup> community<sup>[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1bsxh7g/scalaphp_011_released/)</sup> interest<sup>[3](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/%F0%9F%91%BE-jakub-koz%C5%82owski-5ab49542_scala-php-programming-activity-7180594174100922369-VyUo)</sup>, we've struggled to get funding for the project.
In addition, this has always been an April Fools' Day joke, so its future was doomed from day 1.

Thank you for your interest in Scala.php and see you next year! Perhaps we'll target a more pragmatic language this time, such as [Go](https://go.dev/).
