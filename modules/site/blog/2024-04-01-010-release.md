Scala.php 0.1.0 has been released!

This is the first public release of Scala.php.

Scala.php is a PHP backend for the Scala compiler: it takes your Scala code and outputs PHP code from it,
which you can include into an existing PHP application, run on its own, or package into a library.

You can learn more about its features on [the homepage](/), or you can go ahead and [get started](/docs/getting-started).
