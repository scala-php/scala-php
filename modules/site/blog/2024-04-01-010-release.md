Scala.php 0.1.0 has been released!

This is the first public release of Scala.php.

Scala.php is a PHP backend for the Scala compiler: it takes your Scala code and outputs PHP code from it,
which you can include into an existing PHP application, run on its own, or package into a library.

You can learn more about its features on [the homepage](/), or you can go ahead and [get started](/docs/getting-started).

In the meantime, here's a demo:

```scala title="src/main/scala/Demo.scala"
import java.nio.file.Files
import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.io.StdIn

object Demo {

  def main(
    args: Array[String]
  ): Unit = {

    println("What's your name?")
    val name = StdIn.readLine()

    val greeting = s"Hello $name!"

    Files.writeString(Paths.get("greeting.txt"), greeting)

    println(Files.readString(Paths.get("greeting.txt")))
  }

}
```

```plaintext title="Output"
> What's your name?
< Jakub
> Hello Jakub!
```
